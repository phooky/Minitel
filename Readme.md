Minitel 1B utility scripts
==========================

minitel.py is a script for connecting to a minitel terminal over a serial port and writing data to it from stdin or one or more files. It can also be used to send hex codes directly to the minitel, as well as a clear code or one of several test patterns. Try "python minitel.py --help" for options.

mtimage.py converts any normal image type into a full-screen image for the minitel.
