General instructions for using the minitel over a serial port:

- Set up and open a serial connection to the minitel. If you've put the 
minitel in 4800 baud mode (say, with Fn-B 4), then:
  minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 4800
  Leave the connection open by exiting with Ctrl-A J.
- Set the tty to do newline processing correctly
  stty opost onlcr icrnl </dev/ttyUSB0
- Run whatever
  adventure </dev/ttyUSB0 >/dev/ttyUSB0
